# JMatrix
In this project i've created class in Java that can represent matrices, there are a lot of similarities from "numpy" library for Python.

Inspiration for this project was willing to improve my Java skills, and desire to replicate Artificial Intelligence laboratories from my university, written in Python in which i needed matrices operations.

Feel free to download, edit and use those files.

I would appriciate comments about good and also bad things i did in this project.
